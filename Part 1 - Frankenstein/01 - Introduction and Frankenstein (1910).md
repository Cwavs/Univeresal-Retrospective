<h2 id="introduction---doctor-who">Introduction - Doctor Who?</h2>
<p>Those of you who know me are probably aware that I am quite the big Doctor Who fan. I’ve been following the series for about as long as I can remember, I was introduced to it way back when by my Dad, although I’m not so sure how, I’d need to ask him. Suffice to say though, I like the show a lot, my bedroom walls are dressed with some framed posters from an old magazine, and a fantastic pencil drawing we bought on a trip to Whitby one time. <img src="http://www.cwavs.xyz/IC2dVjMFKHfD6wm5.png" alt="Three framed poster featuring (From left to right) The 4th Doctor; The Cyberleader, Miss Hartigan, The 10th Doctor; Sarah Jane Smith, The 11th Doctor, Jo Grant"><img src="http://www.cwavs.xyz/crdcxu3IRbQpRvgK.png" alt="Pencil drawing of the 10th, 11th and 12th Doctors with the Tardis behind them"></p>
<p>Although my home media collection of series is rather lacking, my collection of Action Figures and annuals more than makes up for it. Now I hear what you’re saying, what in the fucking world does my lifelong obsession with a show about a time travelling alien have to do with Universal Horror, let alone Frankenstein <s>disregarding the fact that they probably share a universe</s>, well there is a method to this madness, you see it all started with one particular peculiarity of the Doctor Who franchise, or rather peculiarities. In the 60s back when there was only one Doctor, who at this time was a human from a distant planet, Dalekmania was at its peak, two films released. Adapting two serials from the show featuring the Daleks (The Daleks, and The Dalek Invasion of Earth respectively) featuring Peter Cushing as Dr Who, a man who invents “Tardis” as it is called in the first film. My first encounter with these films were thanks to The Dalek Collection dvd set which came with both films across two discs. I can vividly remember watching the first film, and well thinking it wasn’t all that interesting, I think I watched it maybe twice in total, the second film however? I loved that film, I watched that second disc over and over, at one point I knew it like the back of my hand. Eventually though I did grow bored of it and move on. Flashforward to earlier this year and Studio Canal announced a 4k re-release on the film, and a limited one day, double bill cinema release of the film. Suffice to say I was excited.  Over the following days, I asked my Dad if he’d like to go and see the films with me, having known he’d already seen them way back when. He agreed, and I watched the page for it on my local cinema like a hawk, waiting for when they announced the date and opened booking, but all of this is really one big tangent. The main thing to focus on here was the fact that Peter Cushing was in the film, naturally, me being me, me and my dad came onto the topic of other Peter Cushing films, I was loosely aware that he had appeared in a few Dracula and Frankenstein films but not much else. This conversation lead to us discussing Frankenstein films, which piqued my interest, so I did what I normally do, I googled it. I’m not sure how many people actually know this, but I love researching, for the sake of it mostly, I love just reading random things, skimming wikipedia articles and picking up a wealth of weird trivia. While I’m not quite sure how I discovered the first piece of this patchwork journey, the first ever Frankenstein adaption, the 1910 Short Silent Film:</p>

<p>…wait don’t do the chapter title just yet, I think I’ve gotten ahead of my self here. I haven’t actually explained what I’m going to be doing with this series yet have I? I got too caught up in the tangents and the story. Uhh well basically, I’m going to be slowly working my way through Universal’s classic horror movies, monster by monster (mostly anyways) Starting with Frankenstein. So uh now you can do the title I guess?</p>
<h2 id="frankenstein-1910">Frankenstein (1910)</h2>
<p>Ok, so I suppose the best place to start here is the best way to watch this short film. Well unlike some of the films that will appear in this series, this one is actually rather easy to find and watch, given its age this film entered the public domain and is now available for anyone to do practically anything to. Like its younger brother “Life without a Soul” this film was lost for quite a while, sometime in the 1950s an American film collector bought a copy of the film, but didn’t realise it was lost until 1970, where it’s existence was announced. Ultimately this lead too three restorations of the film being made, with the most widely  available and used being the 2018 Library of Congress restoration, which is available online for free at their <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2017600664/">website</a>  alternatively there is also a fan derivative restoration of the LOC restoration which adjusts the tints and score to provide a better experience, this is available on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/frankenstein1910HD">internet archive</a>. With the film being very short, coming in at a whopping 16 minutes, I do recommend you check it out before reading this section because you won’t lose anything from doing so, and I wouldn’t want to ruin the experience behind it, take this as a spoiler warning. Without any further ado, lets talk about the film itself.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.cwavs.xyz/flbQq2QaIUtH1dFz.jpg" alt="A poster for Edison's Frankenstein adaption"><br>
Now, I know I said we were going to talk about the film now, but just hold on for a second, I do need to preface this, most of the information you are about to read is sourced from a combination of Wikipedia (or some of the sources it mentions) and the Library of Congress page for the film. There is a fantastic book called “Edison’s Frankenstein” which released alongside the 2010 remaster’s DVD release, however like the DVD itself, it seems this book was a limited run, meaning second hand copies of the book are priced in the ballpark of £90, I am not going to spend that much money on a book for researching this, as much as I’d love to. So I have to rely on what Wikipedia and other site say about the film, and the book’s contents.</p>
<p>The film is interesting, to say the least, although definitely impressive for the time, nowadays the film isn’t that great, an interesting watch for those intrigued it won’t really do much more for you. I do still recommend checking it out however, and as such will only briefly synopsise it here. The film opens with Frankenstein (never referred to by his first name) departing for college to study science. There he discovers the secret to life, with this being one of the only adaptations of Shelly’s work I am aware of to (staying true to the novel) not disclose precisely what the secret is leaving it up to the reader to discern, it does however appear to be something chemical, with him seen excitedly mixing something in a pot, before pouring some liquid in, and then dropping in some mysterious powder. He finally adds some of the mixture to a large basin in a closet resulting in a fire ball emerging from it. He then excitedly seems to proclaim something, before closing the doors and barricading them shut. Now we get to by far the best and most enjoyable part of the movie, the creation scene. Frankenstein peers through a peephole on the door.<br>
<img src="http://www.cwavs.xyz/szMPNZm6IW9P5bZq.png" alt="Frankenstein peering through the peep hole"><br>
We then see the monster come to life inside the basin in a rather cool sequence which looks to involve a doll burning, but played backwards, interceded by cuts back to Frankenstein and his reaction. He then peers in and sees the full creature, a horrific monster, the first screen interpretation of the iconic beast. A shocked and horrified Frankenstein runs out of the room as the monster escapes.<br>

<img src="http://www.cwavs.xyz/D30zz2NLY39cupnl.png" alt="The Monster just after its creation"><br>
Frankenstein, seemingly conflicted over his creation collapses on his bed, but not for long, as the monster peers through the curtains at the end of his bed, the monster seemingly asking Frankenstein for something, however the effort is fruitless as the man passes out shortly after. The creature then delves back into the shadows as the butler walks in and see Frankenstein laying on the floor. The film then jumps to Frankenstein returning home to the surprise of his family and friends. However, the monster has followed him home, and becomes jealous of his creator’s lover. After a quick conversation, the monster hides behind some weird curtain thing as Elizabeth re-enters the room. A shaken Frankenstein leads her out of the room, as the monster awaits his maker’s return, a physical altercation begins between the two but its promptly cut short when the monster gains sight of itself for the first time. The monster, shocked by how it looks, runs out the room.</p>
<p>Later, on the night of Frankenstein’s wedding, he and Elizabeth say goodbye to some guests, as Frankenstein leaves the monster appears, entering the home and seeking out Lizzy, Frankey walks back into the room, discovering the open doors and, after a momentary confusion, realises what is happening after Lizzy runs out of her room, having seen Frankey’s monstey. She then faints as the monster re-appears, taunting him. Frankey demands the monstey leaves. The two fight briefly and the monster flees. Frankenstein chases after it, despite Elizabeth’s best effort.</p>
<p>Some ambiguous amount of time later, the monster re-enters the room with the mirror… for some reason. He then rushes over to the mirror and disappears into it?<br>
<img src="http://www.cwavs.xyz/ros8DYvsrx0Kf8n8.png" alt="The Monster enters the mirror"><br>
Good ol’ Frankenstein enters the room, becoming surprised at the monster being a reflection with no source. He then exclaims something and points at the monster as it disappears, leaving Frankenstein’s reflection. Frankenstein is overjoyed at the monster’s final defeat, with the film ending of him and Elizabeth celebrating.</p>
<h3 id="monsters-and-magic">Monsters, and magic?</h3>
<p>There’s certainly a lot to unpack there, but lets start with the adaptation. The film advertises itself as a “liberal” adaptation of Shelly’s work and it definitely succeeds there. The film is surprisingly faithful to the source, despite its length and the ending. Most of the events up until after Frankenstein’s return are good (if abridged) representations of the source. One of the things that surprised me the most was the quality of the sets and props, they look stunning (despite the film not being in an amazing state). Everything is chock full of detail and attention to it. I just wish the film were available in high quality (and maybe full colour) so we could get a proper look at it all. The doll of the monster in the creation scene  is surprisingly detailed, featuring what looks like bones and meat falling off it. Another thing that surprised me (probably because its my first silent film) was how good the acting was, there were some times where it felt like they were overacting a bit, but most of the time they felt natural, and the cast did a great job conveying their actions without sound and dialogue. The monster’s costume is fantastic. Again covered in minor details, and with a unique design, however it is a departure from what the novel describes, quite heavily. Now onto the elephant in the room… the ending. Its uh a very confusing ending, I’m not really sure what happens or what its trying to imply, but my best guess is that the monster was meant to represent some primal evil inside Frankenstein’s mind, something that had been drawn out of him during the experiments, and this ending implies that they have become one again. That or Frankenstein is the monster, and interesting idea considering it would later adopt, and hijack his name.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>There isn’t too much more to talk about here if I’m honest. This film is a weird one, but well worth your time if you have 20 minutes to spare. Its interesting to look back on, but with it being such a short film, there’s well not much else too it. The deep storytelling and symbolism of the original, and the future adaptations are lost here. There is no old blind man, of attempt at a mate. Just Frankenstein and his monster, running around for a few minutes before one disappears into the other.</p>
